        <h2 id="tytulik">Travel to Cinque Terre</h2>
       
        <h2 class="nagloweczek">  Where is it? </h2>
         <p> The <strong> Cinque Terre </strong> (Italian pronunciation: ['tinwe 'terre]; Ligurian: Cinque Tare, meaning <em> "Five Lands"</em>) is a rugged portion of coast on the Italian Riviera. It is in the Liguria region of Italy, to the west of the city of La Spezia, and comprises five villages:
         <ul>
             <li>
                  Monterosso al Mare,
             </li>
             <li>Vernazza,
             </li>
             <li> Corniglia,
             </li>
             <li>  Manarola,
             </li>
             <li> and Riomaggiore. 
             </li>
         </ul>
        
        </p>
        <h2 class="nagloweczek"> History </h2>
        <p> 
            The first historical documents on the <strong> Cinque Terre </strong> date back to the 11th century. Monterosso and Vernazza sprang up first, while the other villages grew later, under military and political supremacy of the Republic of Genoa. In the 16th century to oppose the attacks by the Turks, the inhabitants reinforced the old forts and built new defence towers. From the year 1600, the <strong> Cinque Terre </strong> experienced a decline which reversed only in the 19th century, thanks to the construction of the Military Arsenal of La Spezia and to the building of the railway line between Genoa and La Spezia. The railway allowed the inhabitants to escape their isolation, but also brought about abandonment of traditional activities. The consequence was an increase in poverty which pushed many to emigrate abroad, at least up to the 1970s, when the development of tourism brought back wealth.

        <h2 class="nagloweczek"> Tourism </h2>
        <p> 
            There are few roads into the <strong> Cinque Terre </strong> towns that are accessible by car: the one into Vernazza is open as of June 2012, but very narrow at many places. It leads to a parking area a kilometre from town. It is best to plan not to travel by car at all, but to park at La Spezia, for instance, and take the trains.

Local trains from La Spezia to Genoa and the rest of the region's network connect the Cinque Terre. Intercity trains also connect the <strong> Cinque Terre </strong> to Milan, Rome, Turin and Tuscany. The <strong> Cinque Terre </strong> tracks run most of the distance in tunnels between Riomaggiore and Monterosso. The <strong> Cinque  Terre </strong> trains connect the La Spezia train station to all five towns. Unlimited day passes are available for tourists, and the trip from one village to another is five minutes or less.

        <h2 class="nagloweczek"> Food and wine </h2>
        <p> 
            Given its location on the Mediterranean, seafood is plentiful in the local cuisine. Anchovies of Monterosso are a local specialty designated with a Protected Designation of Origin status from the European Union. The mountainsides of the <strong> Cinque Terre </strong> are heavily terraced and are used to cultivate grapes and olives. This area, and the region of Liguria, as a whole, is known for pesto, a sauce made from basil leaves, garlic, salt, olive oil, pine nuts and pecorino cheese. Focaccia is a particularly common locally baked bread product. Farinata, a typical snack found in bakeries and pizzerias, is a savoury and crunchy pancake made from a base of chick pea flour. The town of Corniglia is particularly popular for a gelato made from local honey (miele di Corniglia).

The grapes of the <strong> Cinque Terre </strong> are used to produce two locally made wines. The eponymous <strong> Cinque Terre  </strong>and the Sciachetra are both made using Bosco, Albarola, and Vermentino grapes. Both wines are produced by the Cooperative Agricoltura di Cinque Terre, located between Manarola and Volastra. Other DOC producers are Forlini-Capellini, Walter de Batte, Buranco, Arrigoni.

In addition to wines, other popular local drinks include grappa, a brandy made with the pomace left from winemaking, and limoncello, a sweet liqueur flavored with lemons
